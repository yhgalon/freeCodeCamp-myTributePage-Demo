Part 2 - Branching

- Branching is useful and critical for development as you may have places where you may test and find bugs, while having a running app on production.

Remember:
	- When branching, you need to use GIT BRANCH
	- To create a NEW branch, just type GIT CHECKOUT -B <name of the branch>
