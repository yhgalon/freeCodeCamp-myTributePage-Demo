Steps for Git

- first make sure that you have a repo where the file/s can be "pushed" to your Git
- remember the commands

	git add = means that you will be adding a file to be committed (queue)
	git commit -m "<message/info here>"
	git push -u (only for UPSTREAMING) origin <branch>

- also there will be a private and public keys for SSH, make sure to follow those steps before you can be able to "push" the file/s to Git.
